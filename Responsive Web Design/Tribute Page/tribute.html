    <h2 id="intro-header">Introduction</h2>
    <p>John Maynard Keynes was one of the most influential economists, perhaps of all time, and has a branch of economics ("Keyensian Economics") named after him. His ideas formed the basis of macroeconomics; hence, he is known as the "father of macroeconomics". He is best known for his work regarding governmental intervention in markets and mixed economies, and has a book titled "The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money", which was published in 1936.</p>

    <h2 id="keynesian-header">Keynesian Economics</h2>
    <p>"An economic policy advocating a mixed economy, with some state ownership of industries and economic invention to maintain high employment and ensure social cohesion."</p>
    <p>Keynesian economics argue that demand drives supply, and that during a recession, governments should increase spending to create jobs and increase demand, even if it means going into debt.</p>
    <p> They also believe that aggregate supply is the same in the short and long term, so they do not have a short run aggregate supply curve, instead opting for a long run aggregate supply curve that is near perfectly elastic at low levels of real output, and near perfectly inelastic at high levels of real output.</p>

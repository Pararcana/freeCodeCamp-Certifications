        <header>In general:</header>
        <p>Chess is a two player game, where players take turns, with the objective of checkmating their opponent's king. Checkmate is defined as where the king is in check, and has no legal moves to get out of check.</p>

      <section class="how-to-play">
        <header>King</header>
        <p>The king can move one square in any direction. It may also castle with a rook, assuming neither the rook, nor the king have moved previously. You may not castle through check, into check or out of check. Check is defined as when the king can be captured by an opposing piece.</p>

        <header>Pawn</header>
        <p>The pawn can only move forwards one space, unless it has not been moved before, then it may move forwards two spaces. It captures one space diagonally in front of it, and there is a special move that can be used to capture enemy pawns if they move forwards two spaces called "En passant".</p>

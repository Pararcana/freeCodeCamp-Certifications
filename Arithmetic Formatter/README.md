# Arithmetic Formatter

This is the boilerplate for the Arithmetic Formatter project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/arithmetic-formatter

Note that my code is in "arithmetic_arranger.py", the rest of the code is part of the original boilerplate.

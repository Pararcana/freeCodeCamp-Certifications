# Budget App

This is the boilerplate for the Budget App project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/budget-app

Note that my code is in "budget.py", the rest of the code is part of the original boilerplate.
